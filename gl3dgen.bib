  abstract      = {Modeling strong gravitational lenses in order to quantify the distortions in the images of background sources and to reconstruct the mass density in the foreground lenses has traditionally been a difficult computational challenge. As the quality of gravitational lens images increases, the task of fully exploiting the information they contain becomes computationally and algorithmically more difficult. In this work, we use a neural network based on the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) to simultaneously reconstruct an undistorted image of the background source and the lens mass density distribution as pixelated maps. The method we present iteratively reconstructs the model parameters (the source and density map pixels) by learning the process of optimization of their likelihood given the data using the physical model (a ray-tracing simulation), regularized by a prior implicitly learned by the neural network through its training data. When compared to more traditional parametric models, the proposed method is significantly more expressive and can reconstruct complex mass distributions, which we demonstrate by using realistic lensing galaxies taken from the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG.},

  abstract      = {Modeling of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies is often required in order to use them as astrophysical or cosmological probes. With current and upcoming wide-field imaging surveys, the number of detected lenses is increasing significantly such that automated and fast modeling procedures for ground-based data are urgently needed. This is especially pertinent to short-lived lensed transients in order to plan follow-up observations. Therefore, we present in a companion paper (submitted) a neural network predicting the parameter values with corresponding uncertainties of a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile with external shear. In this work, we present a newly-developed pipeline glee_auto.py to model consistently any galaxy-scale lensing system. In contrast to previous automated modeling pipelines that require high-resolution images, glee_auto.py is optimized for ground-based images such as those from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) or the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We further present glee_tools.py, a flexible automation code for individual modeling that has no direct decisions and assumptions implemented. Both pipelines, in addition to our modeling network, minimize the user input time drastically and thus are important for future modeling efforts. We apply the network to 31 real galaxy-scale lenses of HSC and compare the results to the traditional models. In the direct comparison, we find a very good match for the Einstein radius especially for systems with $\theta_E \gtrsim 2$". The lens mass center and ellipticity show reasonable agreement. The main discrepancies are on the external shear as expected from our tests on mock systems. In general, our study demonstrates that neural networks are a viable and ultra fast approach for measuring the lens-galaxy masses from ground-based data in the upcoming era with $\sim10^5$ lenses expected.},

Modeling galaxy-galaxy strong lensing observations presents a number of challenges as the exact configuration of both the background source and foreground lens galaxy is unknown. A timely call, prompted by a number of upcoming surveys anticipating high-resolution lensing images, demands methods that can efficiently model lenses at their full complexity. In this work, we introduce a method that uses continuous neural fields to non-parametrically reconstruct the complex morphology of a source galaxy while simultaneously inferring a distribution over foreground lens galaxy configurations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments on simulated data targeting high-resolution lensing images similar to those anticipated in near-future astrophysical surveys.},

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

  abstract      = {We present a probabilistic model for point cloud generation, which is fundamental for various 3D vision tasks such as shape completion, upsampling, synthesis and data augmentation. Inspired by the diffusion process in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we view points in point clouds as particles in a thermodynamic system in contact with a heat bath, which diffuse from the original distribution to a noise distribution. Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that transforms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. Specifically, we propose to model the reverse diffusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain conditioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding.

Our BNN was trained on synthetic HST-quality images of strongly lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) with lens galaxy light included. The BNN can accurately characterize the posterior PDFs of model parameters governing the elliptical power-law mass profile in an external shear field. We then propagate the BNN-inferred posterior PDFs into ensemble $H_0$ inference, using simulated time delay measurements from a plausible dedicated monitoring campaign. Assuming well-measured time delays and a reasonable set of priors on the environment of the lens, we achieve a median precision of $9.3$\% per lens in the inferred $H_0$. A simple combination of 200 test-set lenses results in a precision of 0.5 $\textrm{km s}^{-1} \textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.7\%$), with no detectable bias in this $H_0$ recovery test. The computation time for the entire pipeline -- including the training set generation, BNN training, and $H_0$ inference -- translates to 9 minutes per lens on average for 200 lenses and converges to 6 minutes per lens as the sample size is increased. Being fully automated and efficient, our pipeline is a promising tool for exploring ensemble-level systematics in lens modeling for $H_0$ inference.},

In this work, we make a step towards that direction by developing the first end-to-end differentiable strong lensing pipeline. Our approach leverages and combines three important computer science developments: (a) convolutional neural networks, (b) efficient gradient-based sampling techniques, and (c) deep probabilistic programming languages. The latter automatize parameter inference and enable the combination of generative deep neural networks and physics components in a single model. In the current work, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine a convolutional neural network trained on galaxy images as a source model with a fully-differentiable and exact implementation of gravitational lensing physics in a single probabilistic model. This does away with hyperparameter tuning for the source model, enables the simultaneous optimization of nearly one hundred source and lens parameters with gradient-based methods, and allows the use of efficient gradient-based posterior sampling techniques. These features make this automated inference pipeline potentially suitable for processing a large amount of data. By analyzing mock lensing systems with different signal-to-noise ratios, we show that lensing parameters are reconstructed with percent-level accuracy. More generally, we consider this work as one of the first steps in establishing differentiable probabilistic programming techniques in the particle astrophysics community, which have the potential to significantly accelerate and improve many complex data analysis tasks.},

This is typically a time and resource-consuming procedure, requiring sophisticated lensing codes, several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum likelihood model parameters in a computationally expensive process with downhill optimizers. Accurate analysis of a single lens can take up to a few weeks and requires the attention of dedicated experts. Tens of thousands of new lenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming generation of ground and space surveys, the analysis of which can be a challenging task. Here we report the use of deep convolutional neural networks to accurately estimate lensing parameters in an extremely fast and automated way, circumventing the difficulties faced by maximum likelihood methods. We also show that lens removal can be made fast and automated using Independent Component Analysis of multi-filter imaging data. Our networks can recover the parameters of the Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid density profile, commonly used to model strong lensing systems, with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of sophisticated models, but about ten million times faster: 100 systems in approximately 1s on a single graphics processing unit. These networks can provide a way for non-experts to obtain lensing parameter estimates for large samples of data. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a powerful and fast alternative to maximum likelihood procedures commonly used in astrophysics, radically transforming the traditional methods of data reduction and analysis.},

  abstract      = {We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9. This is the third paper in a series (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021, Paper I & II, respectively). These surveys together cover $\sim$ 19,000 deg$^2$ visible from the northern hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of $\sim$ 22.5. We use a deep residual neural network, trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and candidates as well as non-lenses in the same footprint. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. We have found 1895 lens candidates. Out of these, 1512 are identified for the first time. Combining the discoveries from this work, Paper I (335) and II (1210), the total number of strong lens candidates from the Legacy Surveys that we have discovered is 3057.},

  abstract      = {Forthcoming large imaging surveys such as Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time are expected to find more than $10^5$ strong gravitational lens systems, including many rare and exotic populations such as compound lenses, but these $10^5$ systems will be interspersed among much larger catalogues of $\sim10^9$ galaxies. This volume of data is too much for visual inspection by volunteers alone to be feasible and gravitational lenses will only appear in a small fraction of these data which could cause a large amount of false positives. Machine learning is the obvious alternative but the algorithms' internal workings are not obviously interpretable, so their selection functions are opaque and it is not clear whether they would select against important rare populations. We design, build, and train several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify strong gravitational lenses using VIS, Y, J, and H bands of simulated data, with F1 scores between 0.83 and 0.91 on 100,000 test set images. We demonstrate for the first time that such CNNs do not select against compound lenses, obtaining recall scores as high as 76\% for compound arcs and 52\% for double rings. We verify this performance using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data of all known compound lens systems. Finally, we explore for the first time the interpretability of these CNNs using Deep Dream, Guided Grad-CAM, and by exploring the kernels of the convolutional layers, to illuminate why CNNs succeed in compound lens selection.},

The software is also able to reconstruct complex extended sources (Birrer et. al 2015) as well as being able to model point sources. We designed Lenstronomy to be stable, flexible and numerically accurate, with a clear user interface that could be deployed across different platforms. Throughout its development, we have actively used Lenstronomy to make several measurements including deriving constraints on dark matter properties in strong lenses, measuring the expansion history of the universe with time-delay cosmography, measuring cosmic shear with Einstein rings and decomposing quasar and host galaxy light. The software is distributed under the MIT license. The documentation, starter guide, example notebooks, source code and installation guidelines can be found at https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io.},

We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of \mu ~ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

  abstract      = {We describe a new non-parametric technique for reconstructing the mass distribution in galaxy clusters with strong lensing, i.e., from multiple images of background galaxies. The observed positions and redshifts of the images are considered as rigid constraints and through the lens (ray-trace) equation they provide us with linear constraint equations. These constraints confine the mass distribution to some allowed region, which is then found by linear programming. Within this allowed region we study in detail the mass distribution with minimum mass-to-light variation; also some others, such as the smoothest mass distribution. The method is applied to the extensively studied cluster Abell 370, which hosts a giant luminous arc and several other multiply imaged background galaxies. Our mass maps are constrained by the observed positions and redshifts (spectroscopic or model-inferred by previous authors) of the giant arc and multiple image systems. The reconstructed maps obtained for \a370 reveal a detailed mass distribution, with substructure quite different from the light distribution. The method predicts the bimodal nature of the cluster and that the projected mass distribution is indeed elongated along the axis defined by the two dominant cD galaxies. But the peaks in the mass distribution appear to be offset from the centres of the cDs. We also present an estimate for the total mass of the central region of the cluster. This is in good agreement with previous mass determinations. The total mass of the central region is M=(2.0-2.7) 10^14 Msun/h50, depending on the solution chosen.},

  abstract      = {Gravitationally lensed curved arcs provide a wealth of information about the underlying lensing distortions. Extracting precise lensing information from extended sources is a key component in many studies aiming to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. To maintain accuracy with increased precision, it is of vital importance to characterize and understand the impact of degeneracies inherent in lensing observables. In this work, we present a formalism to describe the gravitational lensing distortion effects resulting in curved extended arcs based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the local lensing Jacobian and their directional differentials. We identify a non-local and non-linear extended deflector basis that inherits these local properties. Our parameterization is tightly linked to observable features in extended sources and allows one to accurately extract the lensing information of extended images without imposing an explicit global deflector model. We quantify what degeneracies can be broken based on specific assumptions on the local lensing nature and assumed intrinsic source shape. Our formalism is applicable from the weak linear regime, the semi-linear regime all the way up to the highly non-linear regime of highly magnified arcs of multiple images. The methodology and implementation presented in this work provides a framework to assessing systematics, to guide inference efforts in the right choices in complexity based on the data at hand, and to quantify the lensing information extracted in a model-independent way.},

As an application, we show that if an architecture is capable of universal approximation, then modifying its final layer to produce binary values creates a new architecture capable of deterministically approximating any classifier. In particular, we obtain guarantees for deep CNNs and deep feed-forward networks. Our results also have consequences within the scope of geometric deep learning. Specifically, when the input and output spaces are Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, we obtain geometrically meaningful feature and readout maps satisfying our criteria. Consequently, commonly used non-Euclidean regression models between spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices are extended to universal DNNs. The same result allows us to show that the hyperbolic feed-forward networks, used for hierarchical learning, are universal. Our result is also used to show that the common practice of randomizing all but the last two layers of a DNN produces a universal family of functions with probability one. We also provide conditions on a DNN's first (resp. last) few layer's connections and activation function which guarantee that these layers can have a width equal to the input (resp. output) space's dimension while not negatively affecting the architecture's approximation capabilities.},
